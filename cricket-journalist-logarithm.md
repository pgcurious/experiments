# The Numbers Game
### A Cricket Journalist's Accidental Discovery

*By a journalist who thought they knew everything about numbers*

---

## Part 1: The Problem That Wouldn't Go Away

I've been covering cricket for fifteen years.

I've seen Tendulkar's elegance. Kohli's aggression. Root's patience.

I've analyzed thousands of innings. Written hundreds of match reports.

But there was always this *thing* that bothered me.

---

### The Day I Got Frustrated

It was a Tuesday morning. I was comparing batting averages across eras.

Here's what I had:

- **Don Bradman**: 99.94 average
- **Steve Smith**: 58.65 average
- **Joe Root**: 50.12 average
- **Modern player X**: 35.78 average

Easy to compare, right?

**Wrong.**

---

### The Real Question

When I look at those numbers, my brain does something weird.

The difference between Bradman (99.94) and Smith (58.65) is **41.29 runs**.

The difference between Smith (58.65) and Root (50.12) is **8.53 runs**.

But here's the thing that kept me up at night:

**The jump from 50 to 58 feels JUST AS MASSIVE as the jump from 58 to 99.**

Why?

---

## Part 2: Following the Rabbit Hole

I started noticing this pattern everywhere.

### Strike Rates

Look at these T20 strike rates:

- Player A: 100
- Player B: 150
- Player C: 200
- Player D: 250

The *actual* difference between each player is 50 runs per 100 balls.

But the **impact** on the game?

- Going from 100 to 150? **REVOLUTIONARY.**
- Going from 150 to 200? **GAME-CHANGING.**
- Going from 200 to 250? **Nice, but...**

Each jump of 50 feels less impressive than the last.

---

### The Multiplication Thing

I grabbed my notebook. Started scribbling.

What if... what if my brain isn't measuring *addition*?

What if it's measuring *multiplication*?

Look:
- 100 × 1.5 = 150
- 150 × 1.33 = 200
- 200 × 1.25 = 250

The *multipliers* are getting smaller!

That's why each jump feels less impressive!

---

## Part 3: The Scale I Didn't Know I Needed

I decided to do an experiment.

### My Cricket Impact Scale (Version 1.0)

Instead of listing averages normally, what if I measured them by multiplication?

Starting point: 10 runs average (a genuine beginner)

Then I made a scale:
- 10 → 20 (×2) = **1 level up**
- 20 → 40 (×2) = **1 level up**
- 40 → 80 (×2) = **1 level up**

Every time you **double** your average, you go up one level.

---

### Testing My Scale

Let me map some real averages:

- 20 average = **Level 1**
- 40 average = **Level 2**
- 80 average = **Level 3**

But wait, what about 50? Or 60?

They're *between* levels.

I needed smaller steps.

---

## Part 4: Making It Precise

This is where I got obsessed.

### Smaller Multipliers

What if instead of doubling (×2), I used smaller jumps?

I played with multiplication:
- ×1.1 (10% increase)
- ×1.2 (20% increase)
- ×1.5 (50% increase)

I chose ×1.2589... (weird number, but bear with me).

Why? Because if you multiply by this number **10 times**, you get ×2 exactly.

So:
- **10 small steps = 1 doubling**

---

### My New Scale

Starting from 10 runs average:

| Average | My "Level" |
|---------|-----------|
| 10 | 0.0 |
| 12.59 | 1.0 |
| 15.85 | 2.0 |
| 19.95 | 3.0 |
| 25.12 | 4.0 |
| 31.62 | 5.0 |
| 39.81 | 6.0 |
| 50.12 | 7.0 |
| 63.10 | 8.0 |
| 79.43 | 9.0 |
| 100.00 | 10.0 |

---

## Part 5: The Magic Revealed

Now let me map REAL players:

- **Joe Root** (50.12): Level 7.0
- **Steve Smith** (58.65): Level 7.5
- **Virat Kohli** (62.40): Level 7.8
- **Don Bradman** (99.94): Level 10.0

Look at that!

The gap between Smith and Root is **0.5 levels**.
The gap between Kohli and Bradman is **2.2 levels**.

**It finally makes sense to my brain.**

---

### Why This Works

My scale measures **proportional growth**, not absolute numbers.

In cricket:
- Going from 30 to 60 average (**doubling**) is transformational
- Going from 60 to 90 average (**50% increase**) is amazing but different
- Going from 90 to 100 average (**11% increase**) is legendary but subtle

My scale captures this perfectly.

---

## Part 6: Using My Discovery

### Comparing Different Stats

I started applying this to everything:

**Economy Rates (bowling):**
- 8.0 runs per over → Level X
- 6.0 runs per over → Level X + something
- 4.0 runs per over → Level X + more

**Match Scores:**
- 150 runs → Level A
- 300 runs → Level A + ?
- 450 runs → Level A + more?

---

### The Pattern in Cricket History

I analyzed batting averages over time:

**1900s**: Average of top players ≈ 40 (Level 6.0)
**1930s**: Average peaks at 60 (Level 7.8) - Bradman era!
**2000s**: Average around 50 (Level 7.0)
**2020s**: Average around 45 (Level 6.6)

My scale showed that the **rate of change** was more important than absolute numbers.

---

## Part 7: The Real Power

### Predictions

Here's where it got interesting.

I could predict how hard it would be for players to improve:

- A player at 30 average needs to reach **36** for 1 level up
- A player at 60 average needs to reach **72** for 1 level up

Same "difficulty" in my scale = same multiplication factor.

---

### Historical Comparisons

Comparing players across eras became cleaner:

**WG Grace** (1880s): 32.29 average
- But in his era, average was ~20
- His level: **2.2 above era average**

**Don Bradman** (1930s): 99.94 average
- Era average was ~40
- His level: **4.0 above era average**

Bradman was nearly **TWICE** as far ahead of his peers!

---

## Part 8: What I Actually Discovered

I showed my scale to a mathematician friend over coffee.

She laughed. Actually laughed.

"You just invented **logarithms**," she said.

"I did *what* now?"

---

### The Truth

Turns out, what I called "levels" is called a **logarithm** in mathematics.

My multiplication-based scale? **That's literally what logarithms do.**

They convert multiplication into addition.
They measure **orders of magnitude**.
They make **proportional relationships** easy to see.

---

### The Formula

Mathematicians write it as:

**Level = log₁₀(Average / Starting Point)**

Or in my cricket case:

**Level = 10 × log₁₀(Average / 10)**

That's it. That's what I "invented."

---

## Part 9: Why This Matters

### For Cricket

My discovery helps compare:
- **Players across eras** (different base rates)
- **Different formats** (T20 vs Test)
- **Impact vs raw numbers** (what *feels* bigger)

---

### For Everything Else

Once I saw this pattern in cricket, I saw it everywhere:

**Music**:
- Doubling frequency = one octave
- Equal-sounding gaps = multiplication!

**Earthquakes**:
- Richter scale = my cricket levels
- Each +1 = 10× more powerful

**Sound**:
- Decibels work the same way
- Doubling loudness ≠ doubling decibels

---

## Part 10: The Lesson

I spent fifteen years analyzing cricket with normal numbers.

I was using the wrong ruler.

Some things in life are **additive**:
- Height
- Distance
- Time

But many things are **multiplicative**:
- Growth
- Impact
- Perception
- Progress

---

### The Key Insight

When something grows by **multiplication**, measure it with **my scale** (logarithms).

When you double: +1 level
When you triple: +1.58 levels
When you 10×: +10 levels

**Equal multipliers = equal steps on my scale.**

---

## Epilogue: The Numbers Game

I'm still a cricket journalist.

I still watch every ball with the same passion.

But now I see the game differently.

The numbers tell deeper stories.

And sometimes, the best way to understand something...

...is to discover it yourself.

---

## Quick Reference: Your Own Scale

Want to make your own "level" scale? Here's how:

1. **Pick a starting point** (like 10 runs average)
2. **Pick a multiplication** (I used 1.2589 for 10 steps per doubling)
3. **Calculate**: Level = (Number of times you multiply to reach your value)

Or use the formula:
**Level = log(Your Number / Starting Point) / log(Multiplier)**

---

### Try It Yourself

Take any cricket stat.

Ask: "Is this about **addition** or **multiplication**?"

If it's multiplication, use levels.

Your brain will thank you.

**THE END**

*P.S. - To any mathematicians reading this: Yes, I know this is base-10 logarithm scaled by 10. But discovering it through cricket was way more fun than learning it in school.*

*P.P.S. - Don Bradman's level being exactly 10.0 was pure coincidence. Or was it?*
